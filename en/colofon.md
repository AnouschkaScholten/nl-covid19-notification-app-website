# Colophon

The CoronaMelder app has been developed by the Ministry of Public Health, Welfare and Sport in collaboration with the RIVM and the national GGD institutions. The app could not have been realised without the help of dozens of experts, experience experts and a large civilian open-source community, who has monitored the process and tested the app as it was being developed. Everything has been done to create a safe, accessible and user-friendly app that ensures your privacy. And that helps to get — and keep — the coronavirus under control.
